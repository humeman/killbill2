# Kill Bill 2
In the previous game, Kill Bill, we entered Michaelsoft HQ to valiantly take down a deranged Bill who had devised an evil plan to steal all of the computers in the world for himself. 

In the meantime, his minions worked tirelessly to create an AI Bill recreation, far more powerful than before. His sinister plans are once again threatening the world's ability to use their computers, and he needs to be stopped. With a team of players, your task is to take down Bill once again - this time for good.
